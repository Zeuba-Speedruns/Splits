# We Were Here - Splits

### **[LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit) empty splits files.**
- The only difference between the explorer and librarian versions is the splits icons.
- The versions for chess and spike starts obviously do not contain the respective preceding splits. They are intended for training purposes.
